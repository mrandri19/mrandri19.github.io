title: Potentiometers and PWM
author: Andrea Cognolato

Today was nice. I have managed to read the voltage of on a rotary potentiometer with the ADC of the ESP32. Then I have used it to generate a 50Hz PWM which I am using to control the ESC. I have created a [repository](https://github.com/mrandri19/drone-esps) for the code.

But enough with the talk (231 chars so far, could almost fit in a tweet...), here are some pictures.
