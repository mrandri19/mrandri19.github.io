title: I tested a thing

Today I have tested (in my garden), that rod mounted on a hinge so that it rotated.

This is my current setup![](/uploads/untitled-2020-05-21-2359-1.png)

I have tried to use a simple proportional controller but no luck so far. The motor is too powerful so I have to use it at the lower settings possible which has all kinds of nonlinear behaviour, the ESC and IMU are not well calibrated enough.

This is the controller block diagram.

I don't really know what the next steps are? Better ESC calibration I suppose. Or I could go all in and put two motors
