            <h3>Implementation of a trie in f#</h3>
            
            <h4>Backstory</h4>
            <p>In Italy a lot of high school students have latin as a mandatory class and when translating to Italian it's very useful to have a digital dictionary.</p>
            <p>In the past weeks I've been getting more and more fed up with this website: <a href="http://www.dizionario-latino.com/">www.dizionario-latino.com</a>,  which
            is the most popular latin-to-italian dictionary website. It's slow and doesn't offer features such as real-time autocomplete.</p>
            <p>I deciced to download all of its data (the f# crawler is on github <a href="https://github.com/mrandri19/crawler_latino">here</a>) and feed it to Elastichsearch
            to make a simple webpage with fast autocompletion. My adventure began there: I spent 2 days trying to configure it before giving up, it's a good product but I figured
            I wasn't learning anything just by spending time reading the docs and swearing against its query language.</p>
            <p>I wondered how hard it would be to implement a simple autocompletion system that exposed a web api. After searching for an efficient data structure to store and search text
            I stumbled upon the <b>trie</b> and, since I really like f# I started implementing one with it.</p>

            <h4>The data structure</h4>
            <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie">trie</a> or prefix tree it's a very simple tree data structure. It's very efficient at storing words and finding them by prefix
