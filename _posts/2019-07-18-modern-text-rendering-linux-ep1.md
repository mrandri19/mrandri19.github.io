## Introduction

Welcome to part 1 of Modern text rendering in Linux.
In each part of this series we will build a self-contained C program to render a character or sequence of characters.
Each of these programs will implement a feature which I consider essential to achieve state of the art text rendering.

In this first part I will show how to setup FreeType and we will build a console character renderer.

     style="max-width: 20rem; display: block; margin: auto;"/>

This is what you will build. And [here](https://gist.github.com/mrandri19/245237a6bde246f119ab2b6245e540ba) is the code.

## Setup

- My operating system is `Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (bionic)`
- My C compiler is `clang version 6.0.0-1ubuntu2`

### Installing FreeType

On Ubuntu you will need to install FreeType and libpng

```shell
$ sudo apt install libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
$ sudo apt install libpng16-16 libpng-dev
```

- My FreeType version is `2.8.1-2ubuntu2`although, at the time of writing, the most recent version is `FreeType-2.10.1` which will work as well
- My libpng version `(1.6.34-1ubuntu0.18.04.2)`

## The console renderer

#### Create your C file (`main.c` in my case)

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}
```

```shell
$ clang -Wall -Werror -o main main.c
$ ./main
Hello, world
```

#### Include the FreeType libraries

To find the include path (i.e. the directories your compiler traverses when searching for the files you `#include`) for FreeType run:

```shell
$ pkg-config --cflags freetype2
-I/usr/include/freetype2 -I/usr/include/libpng16
```

This line `-I/usr/include/freetype2 -I/usr/include/libpng16` contains the compilation flags needed to include FreeType in the C program

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#include <freetype2/ft2build.h>
#include FT_FREETYPE_H

int main() {
  printf("Hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}
```

```shell
$ clang -I/usr/include/freetype2 \
        -I/usr/include/libpng16  \
        -Wall -Werror            \
        -o main                  \
         main.c
$ ./main
Hello, world
```

#### Print FreeType's version

Inside `main()` initialize FreeType using `FT_Init_FreeType(&ft)` and check for errors (FreeType functions return 0 on success).

(From now on all the functions I will use come from the [FreeType API Reference](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/index.html)).

```c
FT_Library ft;
FT_Error err = FT_Init_FreeType(&ft);
if (err != 0) {
  printf("Failed to initialize FreeType\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

Then using `FT_Library_Version` obtain the version.

```c

FT_Int major, minor, patch;
FT_Library_Version(ft, &major, &minor, &patch);
printf("FreeType's version is %d.%d.%d\n", major, minor, patch);
```

If we compile it using the last command we will have a linker error:

```
/tmp/main-d41304.o: In function `main':
main.c:(.text+0x14): undefined reference to `FT_Init_FreeType'
main.c:(.text+0x54): undefined reference to `FT_Library_Version'
clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)
```

To fix it add `-lfreetype`

```shell
$ clang -I/usr/include/freetype2 \
        -I/usr/include/libpng16  \
        -Wall -Werror            \
        -o main                  \
        -lfreetype               \
         main.c
$ ./main
FreeType's version is 2.8.1
```

#### Loading a font face

The first step to render a character is to load the font file. I am using [ubuntu mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono).

To understand the exact difference between _face_, _family_ and _font_ refer to the [FreeType Docs](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-1.html#section-1).

The third argument is called the _face index_, which was created to allow font creators to embed several faces in a single font size.
Because every font has at least 1 face in it 0 will always work and will select the first one.

```c
FT_Face face;
err = FT_New_Face(ft, "./UbuntuMono.ttf", 0, &face);
if (err != 0) {
  printf("Failed to load face\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### Setting the face's pixel size

With this instruction we tell FreeType our desired width and height for the rendered characters.

We can omit the width by passing 0, FreeType will interpret this as: "same as the other", in this case 32px.
This can be used to render a character with e.g. 10px width and 16px height.

This operation can fail on a fixed-size face, which we will encounter when talking about emojis.

```c
err = FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes(face, 0, 32);
if (err != 0) {
  printf("Failed to set pixel size\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### Getting the character's index

First of all let's go back to the [FreeType docs](https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-1.html#section-2) and establish a naming convention.
A character is not the same thing as a _glyph_. A character is what you have in your `char`, a glyph is an image which is in some way relater to that character.
This relation is quite complex because a char can correspond to many glyphs: i.e. accents. A glyph can correspond to many chars: i.e. ligatures where -> is represented as a single image.

To obtain the index of the glyph corresponding to a character we use `FT_Get_Char_Index`.
This, as you can imagine, only allows one-to-one mapping between characters and glyphs.
We will solve this in a future part by using the _HarfBuzz_ library.

```c
FT_UInt glyph_index = FT_Get_Char_Index(face, 'a');
```

#### Loading a glyph from the face

Having obtained the glyph_index we can load the corresponding glyph from our face.

In a future part we will discuss in depth about the various load flags and how they allow
using features like hinting and bitmap fonts.

```c
FT_Int32 load_flags = FT_LOAD_DEFAULT;
err = FT_Load_Glyph(face, glyph_index, load_flags);
if (err != 0) {
  printf("Failed to load glyph\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### Rendering the glyph in a glyph slot

At this point we can finally render the our glyph into a _glyph slot_, contained in `face->glyph`.

We will discuss the render flags in the future too because they allow using LCD (or Subpixel) Rendering and Grayscale Antialiasing.

```c
FT_Int32 render_flags = FT_RENDER_MODE_NORMAL;
err = FT_Render_Glyph(face->glyph, render_flags);
if (err != 0) {
  printf("Failed to render the glyph\n");
  exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
}
```

#### Printing the glyph to the console

The bitmap of the rendered glyph can be accessed with `face->glyph->bitmap.buffer` and is represented as an unsigned char array, therefore
its values are between 0 and 255.

The buffer is returned as a 1D array but represents a 2D image.
To access the i-th row and j-th column of it we use `column * row_width + row`, as seen in `bitmap.buffer[i * face->glyph->bitmap.pitch + j]`.

You can see that we used `bitmap.width` in the for loop and `bitmap.pitch` in the array access, this is because each row of pixels is `bitmap.width` wide
but the buffer has a "width" of `bitmap.pitch`.

<img src="/assets/images/modern-text-rendering-linux-ep1/Group.svg"
     style="max-width: 20rem; display: block; margin: auto;"/>

In the following code each row and column is iterated and depending on the pixel brightness a different symbol is drawn.

```c
for (size_t i = 0; i < face->glyph->bitmap.rows; i++) {
  for (size_t j = 0; j < face->glyph->bitmap.width; j++) {
    unsigned char pixel_brightness =
        face->glyph->bitmap.buffer[i * face->glyph->bitmap.pitch + j];

    if (pixel_brightness > 169) {
      printf("*");
    } else if (pixel_brightness > 84) {
      printf(".");
    } else {
      printf(" ");
    }
  }
  printf("\n");
}
```

The console output.

```shell
$ clang -I/usr/include/freetype2 \
        -I/usr/include/libpng16  \
        -Wall -Werror            \
        -o main                  \
        -lfreetype               \
         main.c && ./main
FreeType's version is 2.8.1

## Conclusion

We have built a basic console character renderer. This example can, and will,
be extended to render a character in an OpenGL texure, to support emojis,
subpixel rendering, ligatures and much much more. In the the next part we will
talk about Grayscale vs LCD antialiasing and their pros and cons.
