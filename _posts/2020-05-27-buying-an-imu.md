# Buying an IMU

Having finally understood how to control the ESCs with the ESP32, I now want to build a simple project to test the motors and have some fun with control systems.

Something like this: a stick with motor on both ends which tries to stay balanced. Both [Electronoobs]() and [Joop Brokking]() have done something similar.

To build this I need an Inertial Movement Unit. I have decided to buy a GY-521 MPU-6050 3-axis gyro and accelerometer module. It should arrive tomorrow thanks to the magic of Amazon Prime.
