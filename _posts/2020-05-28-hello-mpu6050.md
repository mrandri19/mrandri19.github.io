# Hello, MPU6050

Today, as expected, the Inertial Movement Unit, or IMU, arrived. I did not much have time to play with it, but I did try to take some better pictures.

Other than that I have been trying to interface my ESP32 with the MPU6050 via I2C. Using [i2c_tools](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/peripherals/i2c/i2c_tools) worked and I could identify a device on address `0x68`. TDK provides both a [datasheet](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Datasheet1.pdf) and the [documentation](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/MPU-6000-Register-Map1.pdf) of all of its registers so for now I have just been reading that.
